# Project-1 : 

**Objectives :** 

- Problem Statement : To build a model for Heart Disease Prediction to predict the risk of heart disease in patients

* Relevent Dataset : I will use the kaggle dataset, The Framingham Heart Study is a longituditional dataset of 4000+ records and 15 cardiovascular risk factors.
* Data Loading, Exploration, Visualization : Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : Prepare the data for ML Algorithms
* ML Algorithm : Select a model and train it.
* Hyper-parameter tuning : Fine-tune our model
* 
* Prepare the report : Presenting our solution to predict the risk of heart disease in a patient via preparing a report consisting of step by step explanation of procedure that i will follow to complete the task, result of my analysis and conclusion.

### Step-1 : Problem Statement

I will build a machine learning model for Heart Disease Prediction Task(HDPT), to predict the risk of heart disease in a patient.


### Step-2 : Relevent Dataset 

I will use the kaggle dataset, The Framingham Heart Study is a longituditional dataset of 4000+ records and 15 cardiovascular risk factors.

### Step-3 : Loading, Exploring, Visualization and Feature Analysis of Dataset

Discover and visualize the data to gain insights


### Step-4 : Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Prepare the data for ML Algorithms


### Step-5 : Machine Learning Algorithm

Select a model and train it on dataset and evaluate the performance on test dataset.

### Step-6 : Hyper-parameter tuning 

Fine-tune the trained model parameter to get better accuracy and prediction from the model. after tuning evaluate the performance of the model on test dataset and compare with the previous one.

### Step-7 : Prepare the report

Presenting our solution to predict the risk of heart disease in a patient via preparing a report consisting of step by step explanation of procedure that i will follow to complete the task, result of my analysis and conclusion.
